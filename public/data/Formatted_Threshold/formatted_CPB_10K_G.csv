We  utilize foreign  exchange  forward  purchase  and  sale  contracts  to  hedge  these  exposures.  The  contracts  are  either  designated  as  cashflow  hedging  instruments  or  are undesignated. We hedge portions of our forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to 18 months. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts accounted for as cashflow hedges was $140 million as of July 31, 2022, and $134 million as of August 1, 2021.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  on  the  portion  of  the  derivative  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  of  cashflow  hedges  are  recorded  in  other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in the same statement of earnings line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Any difference between the change in the fair  value  of  the  hedge  components  excluded  from  the  assessment  of  effectiveness  and  the  amounts  recognized  in  earnings  is  recorded  as  a  component  of  other comprehensive income (loss). The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $13 million as of July 31, 2022, and as of August 1, 2021.","['For derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in the same statement of earnings line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.']","We  are  exposed  to  foreign  currency  exchange  risk,  primarily  the  Canadian  dollar,  related  to  thirdparty  transactions  and  intercompany  transactions.
