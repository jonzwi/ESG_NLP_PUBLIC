74.84,"Stakeholders across industries grapple with the question of how to prepare for more intense natural disasters while maintaining course toward achieving their climate targets. These climate threats are compounded by an increasing concern over the threat of cyberattacks and physical sabotage to the centralized grid infrastructure. These acute issues further add to a chronic concern the fragility of decadesold energy system elements that have suffered from deferred maintenance and replacement, which can only be partially remedied by the billions of dollars of new investment from the recently passed infrastructure bill. In an increasingly electrified world, from electric vehicles, to automated manufacturing, to the digitalization of everything, power supply and reliability are more important now than ever. This has elevated the discussion around the essential role that distributed generation and microgrids can play in improving the resilience of both businesses and the grid. As outages increase, businesses are considering the cost of not having power instead of just the cost of power.

Many of these factors are unpredictable and their resolution is often outside of our or our customers’ control. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, including delays in their obtaining financing. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets the timing objectives.

71.45,"Service Revenue  Service revenue is generated from maintenance services agreements. As part of our initial contract with customers for the sale and installation of our Energy Servers, we typically provide a standard oneyear warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship and manufacturing or performance conditions under normal use and service for the first year following commencement of operations. As part of this standard firstyear warranty, we also monitor the operations of the underlying systems and provide output and efficiency guaranties. We have determined that this standard firstyear warranty is a distinct performance obligation  being a promise to standready to maintain the Energy Servers when and if required during the first year following installation. We also sell to our customers extended annual maintenance services that effectively extend the standard firstyear warranty coverage at the customer’s option. These customers generally have an option to renew or cancel the extended maintenance services on an annual basis and nearly every customer has renewed historically. Similar to the standard firstyear warranty, the optional extended annual maintenance services are considered a distinct performance obligation – being a promise to standready to maintain the Energy Servers when and if required during the renewal service year.",[]
71.44,"We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. Given that we typically sell an Energy Server with a maintenance services agreement and have not provided maintenance services to a customer who does not have use of an Energy Server, standalone selling prices are estimated using a costplus approach. Costs relating to Energy Servers include all direct and indirect manufacturing costs, applicable overhead costs and costs for normal production inefficiencies (i.e., variances). We then apply a margin to the Energy Servers, which may vary with the size of the customer, geographic region and the scale of the Energy Server deployment. As our business offerings and eligibility for the ITC evolve over time, we may be required to modify the expected margin in subsequent periods and our revenue could be materially affected. Costs relating to installation include all direct and indirect installation costs. The margin we apply reflects our profit objectives relating to installation. Costs for maintenance services arrangements are estimated over the life of the maintenance contracts and include estimated future service costs and future material costs. Material costs over the period of the service arrangement are impacted significantly by the longevity of the fuel cells themselves. After considering the total service costs, we apply a lower margin to our service costs than to our Energy Servers as it best reflects our longterm service margin expectations and comparable historical industry service margins. As a result, our estimate of our selling price is driven primarily by our expected margin on both the Energy Server and the maintenance services agreements based on their respective costs or, in the case of maintenance services agreements, the estimated costs to be incurred.",[]

The improvement is driven by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This increase was partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 30, 2020, increased freight charges and other supply chainrelated pricing pressures.","['The improvement is driven by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities.']"

The dual class structure of our common stock and the voting agreements among certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control of our Company with KR Sridhar, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and also with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our initial public offering, which limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters and may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.","['The dual class structure of our common stock and the voting agreements among certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control of our Company with KR Sridhar, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and also with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our initial public offering, which limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters and may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.']"
71.18,"Some states in which we operate, including New York, New Jersey and North Carolina, have specific permitting or environmental exemptions for fuel cells. Other states in which we currently operate, including California, have emissionsbased requirements, most of which require permits or other notifications for quantities of emissions that are higher than those observed from our Energy Servers. For example, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District in California has an air permit and risk assessment exemption for emissions of chromium in the hexavalent form (CR6) that are less than 0.00051 lbs/year. Emissions above this level may trigger the need for a permit. Also, California's Proposition 65 requires notification of the presence of CR6 unless public exposure is below 0.001 µg/day, the level determined to represent no significant health risk. Since the California standards are more stringent than those in any other state or foreign location in which we have installed Energy Servers to date, we are focused on California's standards. If stricter standards are adopted in other states or jurisdictions or our servers can’t meet applicable standards, it could impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval and/or could result in us not being able to operate in a particular local jurisdiction.","[""Also, California's Proposition 65 requires notification of the presence of CR6 unless public exposure is below 0.001 µg/day, the level determined to represent no significant health risk.""]"
71.18,"We offer certain customers the opportunity to renew their O&M Agreements (defined herein) on an annual basis, for up to 30 years, at prices predetermined at the time of purchase of the Energy Server. We also provide performance warranties and performance guaranties covering the efficiency and output performance of our Energy Servers. Our pricing of these contracts and our reserves for warranty and replacement are based upon our estimates of the useful life of our Energy Servers and their components, including assumptions regarding improvements in power module life that may fail to materialize. We do not have a long history with a large number of field deployments, especially for new product introductions, and our estimates may prove to be incorrect. Failure to meet these warranty and performance guaranty levels may require us to replace the Energy Servers at our expense or refund their cost to the customer, or require us to make cash payments to the customer based on actual performance, as compared to expected performance, capped at a percentage of the relevant equipment purchase prices. We accrue for product warranty costs and recognize losses on service or performance warranties when required by U.S. GAAP based on our estimates of costs that may be incurred and based on historical experience. However, as we expect our customers to renew their O&M Agreements each year, the total liability over time may be more than the accrual. Actual warranty expenses have in the past been and may in the future be greater than we have assumed in our estimates, the accuracy of which may be hindered due to our limited history operating at our current scale. Therefore, if our estimates of the useful life for our Energy Servers are inaccurate or we do not meet our performance warranties and performance guaranties, or if we fail to accrue adequate warranty and guaranty reserves, our business and financial results could be harmed.","['We accrue for product warranty costs and recognize losses on service or performance warranties when required by U.S. GAAP based on our estimates of costs that may be incurred and based on historical experience.', 'Failure to meet these warranty and performance guaranty levels may require us to replace the Energy Servers at our expense or refund their cost to the customer, or require us to make cash payments to the customer based on actual performance, as compared to expected performance, capped at a percentage of the relevant equipment purchase prices.']"

71.17,"The current generation of our Energy Servers that run on natural gas produces nearly 23% fewer carbon emissions than the average U.S. marginal power generation sources that our projects displace. However, the operation of our current Energy Index to Financial Statements Servers does produce carbon dioxide (""CO2""), which contributes to global climate change. As such, we may be negatively impacted by CO2related changes in applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, or the requirements of the incentive programs on which we and our customers currently rely. Changes (or a lack of change to sufficiently recognize both the risks of climate change and the benefit of our technology as one means to maintain reliable and resilient electric service with a lower greenhouse gas emission profile) in any of the laws, regulations, ordinances, or rules that apply to our installations and new technology could make it more difficult or more costly for us or our customers to install and operate our Energy Servers on particular sites, thereby negatively affecting our ability to deliver cost savings to customers. Certain municipalities have banned or are considering banning new interconnections with gas utilities, while others have adopted bans that allow new interconnections for noncombustion resources, such as our Energy Servers. Some local municipalities have also banned or are considering banning the use of distributed generation products that utilize fossil fuel. Additionally, our customers’ and potential customers’ energy procurement policies may prohibit or limit their willingness to procure our natural gasfueled Energy Servers.
