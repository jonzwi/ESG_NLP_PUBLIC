83.16,"Stakeholders across industries grapple with the question of how to prepare for more intense natural disasters while maintaining course toward achieving their climate targets. These climate threats are compounded by an increasing concern over the threat of cyberattacks and physical sabotage to the centralized grid infrastructure. These acute issues further add to a chronic concern the fragility of decadesold energy system elements that have suffered from deferred maintenance and replacement, which can only be partially remedied by the billions of dollars of new investment from the recently passed infrastructure bill. In an increasingly electrified world, from electric vehicles, to automated manufacturing, to the digitalization of everything, power supply and reliability are more important now than ever. This has elevated the discussion around the essential role that distributed generation and microgrids can play in improving the resilience of both businesses and the grid. As outages increase, businesses are considering the cost of not having power instead of just the cost of power. Energy resilience is becoming an issue business leaders can no longer afford to neglect – both from a strategic and cost perspective.","['These acute issues further add to a chronic concern the fragility of decadesold energy system elements that have suffered from deferred maintenance and replacement, which can only be partially remedied by the billions of dollars of new investment from the recently passed infrastructure bill.', 'These climate threats are compounded by an increasing concern over the threat of cyberattacks and physical sabotage to the centralized grid infrastructure.', 'Stakeholders across industries grapple with the question of how to prepare for more intense natural disasters while maintaining course toward achieving their climate targets.', 'This has elevated the discussion around the essential role that distributed generation and microgrids can play in improving the resilience of both businesses and the grid.', 'Energy resilience is becoming an issue business leaders can no longer afford to neglect – both from a strategic and cost perspective.']"
82.58,"For example, natural gas, which is the primary fuel used in our Energy Servers, contains benzene, which is classified as a hazardous waste if it exceeds 0.5 milligrams per liter. A small amount of benzene found in the public natural gas supply (equivalent to what is present in one gallon of gasoline in an automobile fuel tank, which are exempt from federal regulation) is collected by the gas cleaning units contained in our Energy Servers these gas cleaning units are typically replaced at customers' sites once every 15 to 36 months. From 2010 to late 2016 and in the regular course of maintenance of the Energy Servers, we periodically replaced the units in our servers relying upon a federal environmental exemption that permitted the handling of such units without manifesting the contents as containing a hazardous waste. Although over the years and with the approval of two states, we believed that we operated appropriately under the exemption, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") issued guidance for the first time in late 2016 that differed from our belief and conflicted with the state approvals we had obtained. We have complied with the new guidance and, given the comparatively small quantities of benzene produced, we do not anticipate significant additional costs or risks from our compliance with the revised 2016 guidance. In order to put this matter behind us and with no admission of law or fact, we agreed to a consent agreement that was ratified and incorporated by reference into a final order that was entered by an Environmental Appeals Judge for EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board in May of 2020.

There have been a number of disruptions throughout the global supply chain as the global economy opens up and drives demand for certain components that has outpaced the return of the global supply chain to full production. Although we were able to find alternatives for many component shortages, we experienced some delays and cost increases with respect to container shortages, ocean shipping and air freight. We have put actions in place to mitigate the disruptions by booking alternate sea routes, limiting our use of air shipments, creating virtual hubs and consolidating shipments coming from the same region. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we continued to manage disruptions from an increase in lead times for most of our components due to a variety of factors, including supply shortages, shipping delays and labor shortages, and we expect this to continue through the first half of 2022.

79.93,"Because our Energy Servers are designed to operate at a constant output 24x7, while our customers’ demand for electricity typically fluctuates over the course of the day or week, there are often periods when our Energy Servers are producing more electricity than a customer may require, and such excess electricity must generally be exported to the local electric utility. Export of customergenerated power is generally provided for in the United States under federal, state or local laws and regulations. Many, but not all, local electric utilities provide compensation to our customers for such electricity under fuel cell net metering (which often differs from solar net metering) or other customer generation programs. Utility tariffs and fees, interconnection agreements and fuel cell net metering requirements are subject to changes in availability and terms, and some jurisdictions do not allow interconnections or export at all. At times in the past, such changes have had the effect of significantly reducing or eliminating the benefits of such programs. Changes in the availability of, or benefits offered by, utility tariffs, the applicable net metering requirements or interconnection agreements in the jurisdictions in which we operate or in which we anticipate expanding into in the future could adversely affect the demand for our Energy Servers. For example, in California, the fuel cell net metering tariff currently expires in 2023. We cannot predict the outcome of regulatory proceedings addressing tariffs that would include customers utilizing fuel cells. If there is not an economical tariff for customers utilizing fuel cells in a given jurisdiction, it may limit or end our ability to sell and install our Energy Servers in that jurisdiction.

We then apply a margin to the Energy Servers which may vary with the size of the customer, geographic region and the scale of the Energy Server deployment. Costs relating to installation include all direct and indirect installation costs. The margin we apply reflects our profit objectives relating to installation. Costs for Index to Financial Statements maintenance service arrangements are estimated over the life of the maintenance contracts and include estimated future service costs and future material costs. Material costs over the period of the service arrangement are impacted significantly by the longevity of the fuel cells themselves. After considering the total service costs, we apply a lower margin to our service costs than to our Energy Servers as it best reflects our longterm service margin expectations and comparable historical industry service margins.

Deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. This determination is based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Furthermore, uncertain tax positions are evaluated by management and amounts are recorded when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Significant judgement is required throughout management's process in evaluating each uncertain tax position including future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies to determine whether the more likely than not recognition threshold has been met.

While we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review and put in place controls to reduce the likelihood for errors, we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error if we are unable to implement key operation controls around pricing, spending and other financial processes. For example, prior to our adoption of Section 404B of the SarbanesOxley Act, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2019 related to the accounting for and disclosure of complex or nonroutine transactions, which has been remediated. If we are unable to successfully maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.",[]

The Operating Company also enters into a master services agreement with us following the first year of service to extend the warranty services and guaranties over the term of the PPA. In other cases, the master services agreements including performance warranties and guaranties are billed on a quarterly basis starting in the first quarter following the placedinservice date of the Energy Server(s) and continuing over the term of the PPA. The first of such arrangements was considered a salestype lease and the product revenue from that agreement was recognized upfront in the same manner as direct purchase and lease transactions. Substantially all of our subsequent PPAs have been accounted for as operating leases with the related revenue under those agreements recognized ratably over the PPA term as electricity revenue. We recognize the cost of revenue, primarily product costs and maintenance service costs, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the Energy Server or the term of the PPA.","['We recognize the cost of revenue, primarily product costs and maintenance service costs, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the Energy Server or the term of the PPA.']"

We have a global supply chain and obtain components from Asia, Europe and India. In many cases, the components we obtain are jointly developed with our suppliers and unique to us, which makes it difficult to obtain and qualify alternative suppliers should our suppliers be impacted by the COVID19 pandemic or related effects.",[]

In addition, at any point in time, our ability to deploy our backlog is contingent on securing available financing. Our ability to attract thirdparty financing depends on many factors that are outside of our control, including an investors' ability to utilize tax credits and other government incentives, interest rate and/or currency exchange fluctuations, our perceived creditworthiness and the condition of credit markets generally.

72.4,"The timing of delivery and installations of our products has a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of product and installation revenue. Many factors can cause a lag between the time a customer signs a purchase order and our recognition of product revenue. These factors include the number of Energy Servers installed per site, local permitting and utility requirements, environmental, health and safety requirements, weather, and customer facility construction schedules. Many of these factors are unpredictable and their resolution is often outside of our or our customers’ control. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, including delays in their obtaining financing. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets the timing objectives. These unexpected delays and expenses can be exacerbated in periods in which we deliver and install a larger number of smaller projects. In addition, if even relatively short delays occur, there may be a significant shortfall between the revenue we expect to generate in a particular period and the revenue that we are able to recognize.
