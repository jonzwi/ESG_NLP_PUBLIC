Beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on individual, business, and government activities. The easing of restrictions and the existence of variant strains of COVID-19 may lead to a rise in infections, which could result in the reinstatement of some of the restrictions previously in place and the implementation of new restrictions and mandates, and there are ongoing global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from the pandemic including labor shortages, logistical challenges such as increased port congestion, and increases in costs for certain goods and services. While the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.",[]
72.75,"The EPA encouraged PRPs to step forward (individually or in groups) to enter into consent agreements to perform remedial design in various project areas covering the entire Site. While certain PRPs executed consent agreements for remedial design work, because of the EPA’s refusal to date to modify the remedy to reflect the most current data on Site conditions and because of concerns with the terms of the consent agreement, we elected not to enter into a consent agreement. In April 2020, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order (“UAO”) to us and MMGL, LLC (“MMGL”), an unaffiliated company, for the remedial design work in a portion of the Site designated as the River Mile 3.5 East Project Area. As required by the UAO, we notified the EPA of our intent to comply while reserving all of our sufficient cause defenses. Failure to comply with a UAO, without sufficient cause, could subject us to significant penalties or treble damages. Pursuant to the optimized remedial design timeline set forth in the UAO, the EPA’s expected schedule for completion of the remedial design work is four years. The EPA has estimated the cost of the work at approximately $4 million. We have agreed with the other respondent to the UAO, MMGL, that we will lead the performance and be responsible for a portion of the costs of the work for remedial design under the UAO and also entered into an agreement with another PRP pursuant to which such other PRP has agreed to fund a portion of the costs of such work. These agreements are not an allocation of liability or claims associated with the Site as between the respondents or with respect to any third party. We estimated that our share of the costs of performing such work under the UAO would be approximately $3 million, which we recorded to environmental liabilities and selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We have insurance policies pursuant to which we are being reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for remedial design. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded an insurance receivable and a related insurance recovery to selling, general, and administrative expense for approximately $3 million. We also expect to pursue in the future allocation or contribution from other PRPs for a portion of such remedial design costs. In February 2021, the EPA announced that 100 percent of the Site’s areas requiring active cleanup are in the remedial design phase of the process.","['We have agreed with the other respondent to the UAO, MMGL, that we will lead the performance and be responsible for a portion of the costs of the work for remedial design under the UAO and also entered into an agreement with another PRP pursuant to which such other PRP has agreed to fund a portion of the costs of such work.', 'The EPA encouraged PRPs to step forward (individually or in groups) to enter into consent agreements to perform remedial design in various project areas covering the entire Site.']"

72.69," Company tests long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Operating lease right-of-use assets are considered long-lived assets subject to this impairment testing. The segment realignment completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 described above in this Note under “Segment Reporting” did not significantly impact the composition of the Company’s asset groups. For the Company’s metals recycling operations, an asset group generally consists of the regional shredding and export operation along with surrounding feeder operations, except that the combined Oregon metals recycling and steel manufacturing operations is a single asset group. For regions with no shredding and export operations, each metals recycling facility is an asset group. For the Company’s auto parts operations, generally each auto parts store is an asset group. The Company tests its asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the Company’s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group.","['For the Company’s metals recycling operations, an asset group generally consists of the regional shredding and export operation along with surrounding feeder operations, except that the combined Oregon metals recycling and steel manufacturing operations is a single asset group.', 'Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group.', ' Company tests long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.']"

Pursuant to determinations under section 66260.200(f) of the state hazardous waste regulations issued in 1988 and 1989 (the “f letters”), the DTSC determined that treated shredder waste from the Company’s facility does not pose a significant hazard to human health, safety, or the environment.

The Superior Court reached this decision despite a determination by DTSC in 2018 pursuant to the 2014 statute reconfirming that treated shredder residue does not need to be managed as a hazardous waste in order to protect human health, safety, or the environment.

72.13,"Federal, state, and local regulators have increased their focus on metals recycling and auto dismantling facilities that has or could lead to new or expanding regulatory requirements. In July 2021, the EPA issued an enforcement alert reflecting a national enforcement initiative in conjunction with state regulators focused on Clean Air Act compliance at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders. While we believe we are an industry leader in emission controls and have been working with state and local regulators on compliance and permitting matters, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to enforcement actions or litigation by regulators or private parties that could result in additional penalties, compliance requirements, or capital investments. See “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this report. In addition, on October 15, 2021, the California State Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) submitted proposed emergency regulations to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) that would require metal shredding facilities in California, including our Oakland facility, to operate under state hazardous waste facility permits. OAL has 10 calendar days within which to review and make a decision on the proposed emergency rulemaking. If the emergency regulations are approved, metal shredding facilities in California would have 30 days to file to obtain “interim status” that, according to DTSC, is necessary for facilities to continue operating through the permit application process, which could take as long as five years. The California metal recycling industry is working with DTSC to identify an alternative regulatory framework and permitting regime under existing law that could accommodate the unique aspects of metal shredding facility operations. Operating under DTSC’s hazardous waste permitting requirements, including under interim status regulations, or under an alternative permitting structure could require substantial additional capital expenditures, impose financial assurance obligations, subject us to increased compliance and penalty risks, severely limit operational flexibility and increase operating costs, or adversely impact our ability to acquire or sell materials at our California facilities.","['The California metal recycling industry is working with DTSC to identify an alternative regulatory framework and permitting regime under existing law that could accommodate the unique aspects of metal shredding facility operations.', 'Operating under DTSC’s hazardous waste permitting requirements, including under interim status regulations, or under an alternative permitting structure could require substantial additional capital expenditures, impose financial assurance obligations, subject us to increased compliance and penalty risks, severely limit operational flexibility and increase operating costs, or adversely impact our ability to acquire or sell materials at our California facilities.']"

In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions. In the past, overcapacity and excess steel production in these foreign countries resulted in the export of aggressively priced semi-finished and finished steel products. This led to disruptions in steel-making operations within other countries, negatively impacting demand for our recycled metal products used by EAF mills globally as their primary feedstock. Further, the import of foreign steel products into the U.S. at similarly aggressive prices have in the past adversely impacted finished steel sales prices and sales volumes. Existing or new trade laws and regulations may cause or be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although trade regulations restrict or impose duties on the importation of certain products, if foreign steel production significantly exceeds consumption in those countries, global demand for our recycled metal products could decline and imports of steel products into the U.S. could increase, resulting in lower volumes and selling prices for our recycled metal products and finished steel products.","['In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions.']"

Most of the Company’s lease obligations relate to real property leases for the Company’s operating sites, including the substantial majority of its auto parts stores, and for the Company’s administrative offices. The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception by assessing whether it receives the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from use of the underlying asset. Lease classification, measurement, and recognition are determined at lease commencement, which is the date the underlying asset is available for use by the Company. The accounting classification of a lease is based on whether the arrangement is effectively a financed purchase of the underlying asset (finance lease) or not (operating lease). Leases that, at lease commencement, have a non-cancellable lease term of   months or less and do not include an option to either purchase the underlying asset or renew the lease beyond   months that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the balance sheet.",[]

Although the synergies from our integrated operations allow us to be our own source for some raw materials, particularly with respect to recycled metal for our steel manufacturing operations, we rely on other suppliers for most of our raw material and other input needs, including inputs to steel production such as graphite electrodes, alloys, and other required consumables. Industry supply conditions generally involve risks, including the possibility of shortages of raw materials, increases in raw material and other input costs, and reduced control over delivery schedules. We procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metal to us. In periods of declining or lower recycled metal prices suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities, tightening supply. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling scrap metal to us, we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

In fiscal 2021, the average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products increased by 61% and 60%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year. The deterioration in global economic conditions that occurred in fiscal 2020 in large part due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic reflected among other things the curtailment of many commercial and government-sponsored activities using steel and other metal materials, causing metal commodity prices to decrease sharply and widespread destocking of inventories. As global economies revived and commercial and investment activities resumed, including throughout fiscal 2021, demand for recycled metals and finished steel increased substantially, which contributed to periods of sharp increases in market selling prices for these products. Increased focus on decarbonization strategies by governments and businesses around the world, including investments in infrastructure and technologies that minimize carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels, among other factors, also contributed to strong demand for most of our products in fiscal 2021 and support global long-term demand for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal. In fiscal 2021, we observed a trend of increased use of recycled metals to manufacture new products, including greater use of EAF technology for steel production which uses recycled metal as a primary raw material. Average selling prices for our finished steel products, which are produced in our steel mill using EAF technology, increased by 17% compared to the prior fiscal year.","['Increased focus on decarbonization strategies by governments and businesses around the world, including investments in infrastructure and technologies that minimize carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels, among other factors, also contributed to strong demand for most of our products in fiscal 2021 and support global long-term demand for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal.']"
