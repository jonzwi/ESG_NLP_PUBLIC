75.0,"The Company recognizes revenue upon satisfying its promises to transfer goods or services to customers under the terms of its contracts. Nearly all of these promises, referred to as performance obligations, consist of the transfer of physical goods, including recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal, auto bodies, auto parts, and finished steel products, to customers. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer, which in nearly all cases is when title to and risk of loss of the goods transfer to the customer. The timing of transfer of title and risk of loss is dictated by customary or explicitly stated contract terms. For example, the Company recognizes revenue on partially loaded bulk shipments of recycled ferrous metal when contractual terms support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss. The significant majority of the Company’s sales involve transfer of control to the customer, and thus revenue recognition, before delivery to the customer’s destination; for example, upon release of the goods to the shipper. The Company’s bill-and-hold arrangements involve transfer of control to the customer when the goods have been segregated from other inventory at the Company’s facility and are ready for physical transfer to the customer. Shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer has obtained control of a good are accounted for as fulfillment costs rather than an additional promise in a contract. As such, shipping and handling consideration (freight revenue) is recognized when control of the goods transfers to the customer, and freight expense is accrued to cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized.","['These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer, which in nearly all cases is when title to and risk of loss of the goods transfer to the customer.', 'Nearly all of these promises, referred to as performance obligations, consist of the transfer of physical goods, including recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal, auto bodies, auto parts, and finished steel products, to customers.', 'The significant majority of the Company’s sales involve transfer of control to the customer, and thus revenue recognition, before delivery to the customer’s destination; for example, upon release of the goods to the shipper.', 'The Company recognizes revenue upon satisfying its promises to transfer goods or services to customers under the terms of its contracts.', 'Shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer has obtained control of a good are accounted for as fulfillment costs rather than an additional promise in a contract.', 'For example, the Company recognizes revenue on partially loaded bulk shipments of recycled ferrous metal when contractual terms support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss.', 'The Company’s bill-and-hold arrangements involve transfer of control to the customer when the goods have been segregated from other inventory at the Company’s facility and are ready for physical transfer to the customer.', 'The timing of transfer of title and risk of loss is dictated by customary or explicitly stated contract terms.']"

If further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these liabilities, the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated. Adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which accruals are established are made. The factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include:","['To manage these risks, we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants.', 'Environmental management and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks.', 'We operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks.', 'If further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these liabilities, the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated.', 'The factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include:', 'The regulatory and government management of these projects is complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation.']"

The segment realignment completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 described above in this Note under “Segment Reporting” did not significantly impact the composition of the Company’s asset groups.

For regions with no shredding and export operations, each metals recycling facility is an asset group. For the Company’s auto parts operations, generally each auto parts store is an asset group. The Company tests its asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the Company’s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group.","['For the Company’s metals recycling operations, an asset group generally consists of the regional shredding and export operation along with surrounding feeder operations, except that the combined Oregon metals recycling and steel manufacturing operations is a single asset group.', 'Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group.', ' Company tests long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.', 'The Company tests its asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired.']"

In addition, the ODEQ Cleaner Air Oregon (“CAO”) program regulates toxic air emissions from manufacturing facilities located in Oregon. The ODEQ has published a prioritization list of the facilities within the state subject to the CAO program based on emissions inventories that facilities submitted to the ODEQ. The prioritization list established four tiers of risk groups. Our steel mill has been assigned to the first-tier risk group and was selected into the CAO program in 2020. To comply with the CAO program rules, including as they may be revised in the future, facilities may incur expenses to evaluate the risk to the public and may be required to incur additional operating or capital expenditures to mitigate any significant identified risks.","['To comply with the CAO program rules, including as they may be revised in the future, facilities may incur expenses to evaluate the risk to the public and may be required to incur additional operating or capital expenditures to mitigate any significant identified risks.', 'In addition, the ODEQ Cleaner Air Oregon (“CAO”) program regulates toxic air emissions from manufacturing facilities located in Oregon.', 'A number of states, including states in which we have operations and facilities, have considered, are considering, or have already enacted legislation or executive action to develop information or address climate change and GHG emissions, including state-level “cap and trade” programs.', 'The ODEQ has published a prioritization list of the facilities within the state subject to the CAO program based on emissions inventories that facilities submitted to the ODEQ.', 'The prioritization list established four tiers of risk groups.']"

In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions. In the past, overcapacity and excess steel production in these foreign countries resulted in the export of aggressively priced semi-finished and finished steel products. This led to disruptions in steel-making operations within other countries, negatively impacting demand for our recycled metal products used by EAF mills globally as their primary feedstock.

Existing or new trade laws and regulations may cause or be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although trade regulations restrict or impose duties on the importation of certain products, if foreign steel production significantly exceeds consumption in those countries, global demand for our recycled metal products could decline and imports of steel products into the U.S. could increase, resulting in lower volumes and selling prices for our recycled metal products and finished steel products.","['Existing or new trade laws and regulations may cause or be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.', 'In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions.']"
