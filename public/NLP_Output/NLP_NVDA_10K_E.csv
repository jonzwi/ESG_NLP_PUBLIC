Given  that  our  resources  are  limited,  if  we  pursue  a  particular transaction,  we may  limit  our ability  to enter  into  other  transactions  that  could help us achieve our strategic  objectives.  If  we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can  take  place  which  could  reduce  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the  transaction  and  negatively  impact  our  business.  For  example,  on  February  8, 2022,  NVIDIA  and  SoftBank  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  whereby  NVIDIA  would  have  acquired  Arm  from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction.

In  addition,  to  the  extent  that  our  perceived  ability  to  consummate  acquisitions  has  been  harmed,  future  acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.","['Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our  products  and  ultimately  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  financial  results.

Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel,  and  may  reduce  demand  for  our  new  GPUs.  We  have  introduced  LHR  GeForce  GPUs  with  limited  Ethereum  mining  capability  and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to nonmining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome.

Marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported  at  fair  value  with  the  related  unrealized  gains  or  losses  included  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  or  loss,  a  component  of shareholders’  equity,  net  of  tax.  Fair  value  of  the  marketable  securities  is  determined  based  on  quoted  market  prices.  Derivative  instruments  are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended  use  of  the  derivative  and  the  resulting  designation.  For  derivative  instruments  designated  as  fair  value  hedges,  the  gains  or  losses  are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component  of  other  comprehensive  income  or  loss  and  is  subsequently  recognized  in  earnings  when  the  hedged  exposure  is  recognized  in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.",[]
