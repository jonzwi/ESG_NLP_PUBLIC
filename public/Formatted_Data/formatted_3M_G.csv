The Company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan assets, deferring over three years the impact on  these amounts of asset gains or losses that differed from expected returns. 3M changed to the fair value approach for calculating  marketrelated value for the fixed income class of plan assets, which does not involve deferring the impact of excess plan asset  gains or losses in the determination of these two components of net periodic benefit cost. 3M considers the use of the fair value  approach preferable to the calculated value approach as it results in a more current reflection of impacts of changes in value of  these plan assets in the determination of net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, given the plans’ liabilitydriven investment  strategy whereby the changes in value of the fixed income plan assets should offset changes in the value of the plans’ liabilities,  this approach more closely aligns the expected return on plan assets expense component with the value reflected in the plans’  funded status.
