The current environmental proceedings associated with Beatrice include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's possible status as a potentially responsible party at approximately 35 Superfund, proposed Superfund, or stateequivalent sites (the ""Beatrice sites""). These sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental proceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatricerelated environmental matters totaled $39.9 million ($2.0 million within other accrued liabilities and $37.9 million within other noncurrent liabilities) as of May 29, 2022, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and stateequivalent sites referenced above. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, a final Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study was submitted for the Southwest Properties portion (""Operating Unit 4"") of the Wells G&H Superfund site, which is one of the Beatrice sites. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") issued a Record of Decision (""ROD"") for the Southwest Properties portion of the site on September 29, 2017 and entered into negotiations with potentially responsible parties to determine final responsibility for implementing the ROD. On September 14, 2020, the district court entered a consent decree among EPA and the settling defendants, including the Company. On May 24, 2022, BFEL Indemnitor, Inc.
