Plaintiffs allege that  3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont, Chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants.  This case has been removed from state court to federal court, and plaintiffs have withdrawn its motion to remand to state court  and filed an amended complaint. 3M has filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In February 2021, the court raised  the question whether subject matter jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act was proper, issued an order requiring the  parties to brief the issue and denied defendants’ motions to dismiss with leave to renew pending the court’s ruling on  jurisdiction. An oral argument was held in September 2021. In December 2021, the court issued an order retaining jurisdiction  over the case and 3M renewed its previous motion to dismiss.","[70.75, 25.75, 3.5]",neutral,"[99.95, 0.02, 0.04]",neutral,"[67.68, 3.83, 28.5]",neutral
