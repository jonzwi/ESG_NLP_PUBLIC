Goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value.

Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired.
