Net operating income can be used to measure the initial  stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property.  Net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the  results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real  estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization,  because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level.  Impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate  to be propertylevel operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the  current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses.

Therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property  level. Our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as  losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. Property operating expenses included in  determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and  maintenance rental expense related to ground leases contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping property  taxes and insurance and propertylevel salaries.
