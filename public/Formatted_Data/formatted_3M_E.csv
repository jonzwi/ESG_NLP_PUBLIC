In August 2021, the Flemish Government served 3M Belgium with a notice of intent  to impose a safety measure (wastewater discharge stoppage) and issued an infraction report alleging permit and/or legal  violations in connection with the discharge of certain specific PFAS compounds for alleged lack of specific authorization.  Following discussions with the government officials, 3M Belgium implemented a focused safety measure that would allow  continued production activities and plans to contest through appeal the underlying legal and factual basis for the safety measure.  Separately, the permitting authority has initiated a process to tighten the wastewater discharge limits immediately.

In 2018,  3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts  state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs  against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal  miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling  $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. During March and April 2019, the  Company agreed in principle to settle a substantial majority of the thenpending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West  Virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in April 2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above. That settlement was  completed in 2019, and the appeal has been dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King  County, Washington, involving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3M’s 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted  negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. The jury delivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M,  concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a cause of  plaintiff’s mesothelioma. The plaintiff’s appeal is pending. A ruling is expected during the first quarter of 2022.","[89.24, 8.19, 2.58]",neutral,"[3.13, 2.89, 93.97]",negative,"[55.52, 7.97, 36.51]",neutral
