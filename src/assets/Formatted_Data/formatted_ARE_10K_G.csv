A  share award is an award of common stock that (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of forfeiture under  Section 83 of the Code. Shares issued generally vest over a fouryear period from the date of issuance, and the sale of the shares is  restricted prior to the date of vesting.

The unearned portion of timebased share awards is amortized as stock compensation expense on a straightline  basis over the vesting period. Certain restricted share awards are subject to vesting based upon the satisfaction of levels of  performance and market conditions. Failure to satisfy the threshold performance conditions will result in the forfeiture of shares.  Forfeiture of share awards with timebased or performancebased restrictions results in a reversal of previously recognized sharebased  compensation expense.
