While we believe we are an industry leader in emission controls and have been working with state and local regulators on compliance and permitting matters, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to enforcement actions or litigation by regulators or private parties that could result in additional penalties, compliance requirements, or capital investments. See “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this report. In addition, on October 15, 2021, the California State Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) submitted proposed emergency regulations to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) that would require metal shredding facilities in California, including our Oakland facility, to operate under state hazardous waste facility permits. OAL has 10 calendar days within which to review and make a decision on the proposed emergency rulemaking. If the emergency regulations are approved, metal shredding facilities in California would have 30 days to file to obtain “interim status” that, according to DTSC, is necessary for facilities to continue operating through the permit application process, which could take as long as five years. The California metal recycling industry is working with DTSC to identify an alternative regulatory framework and permitting regime under existing law that could accommodate the unique aspects of metal shredding facility operations. Operating under DTSC’s hazardous waste permitting requirements, including under interim status regulations, or under an alternative permitting structure could require substantial additional capital expenditures, impose financial assurance obligations, subject us to increased compliance and penalty risks, severely limit operational flexibility and increase operating costs, or adversely impact our ability to acquire or sell materials at our California facilities.","['While we believe we are an industry leader in emission controls and have been working with state and local regulators on compliance and permitting matters, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to enforcement actions or litigation by regulators or private parties that could result in additional penalties, compliance requirements, or capital investments.', 'Operating under DTSC’s hazardous waste permitting requirements, including under interim status regulations, or under an alternative permitting structure could require substantial additional capital expenditures, impose financial assurance obligations, subject us to increased compliance and penalty risks, severely limit operational flexibility and increase operating costs, or adversely impact our ability to acquire or sell materials at our California facilities.', 'In July 2021, the EPA issued an enforcement alert reflecting a national enforcement initiative in conjunction with state regulators focused on Clean Air Act compliance at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders.', 'Federal, state, and local regulators have increased their focus on metals recycling and auto dismantling facilities that has or could lead to new or expanding regulatory requirements.', 'In addition, on October 15, 2021, the California State Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) submitted proposed emergency regulations to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) that would require metal shredding facilities in California, including our Oakland facility, to operate under state hazardous waste facility permits.', 'The California metal recycling industry is working with DTSC to identify an alternative regulatory framework and permitting regime under existing law that could accommodate the unique aspects of metal shredding facility operations.']"

Settlement discussions of the alleged violations had resulted in a tentative agreement in April 2018 among the COAG, DTSC, and Schnitzer Fresno, Inc. to settle the matter for $490 thousand, of which $368 thousand was to be paid as a civil penalty and $122 thousand was to be paid as reimbursement for agency investigation and enforcement costs.

Our shredders are designed to provide a denser product and, in conjunction with advanced separation equipment, a more refined form of recycled ferrous metal which can be used efficiently by steel mills in the production of new steel. The shredding process reduces auto bodies and other scrap metal into fist-size pieces of shredded recycled metal. The shredded material is then carried by conveyor under magnetized drums that attract the ferrous metal and separate it from the mixed nonferrous metal and other residue, resulting in a consistent and high-quality shredded ferrous product.

74.93,"The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which we operate are difficult to predict and are influenced by different economic conditions in the domestic market, where we typically acquire our raw materials, and foreign markets, where we typically sell the majority of our products. Purchase prices for scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles and selling prices for recycled metal are subject to market forces beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to our metal purchase prices, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our metal purchase prices to fully offset a sharp reduction in recycled metal sales prices, which may adversely impact our operating income and cash flows.

These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer, which in nearly all cases is when title to and risk of loss of the goods transfer to the customer. The timing of transfer of title and risk of loss is dictated by customary or explicitly stated contract terms. For example, the Company recognizes revenue on partially loaded bulk shipments of recycled ferrous metal when contractual terms support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss. The significant majority of the Company’s sales involve transfer of control to the customer, and thus revenue recognition, before delivery to the customer’s destination; for example, upon release of the goods to the shipper. The Company’s bill-and-hold arrangements involve transfer of control to the customer when the goods have been segregated from other inventory at the Company’s facility and are ready for physical transfer to the customer. Shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer has obtained control of a good are accounted for as fulfillment costs rather than an additional promise in a contract.

The accounting process the Company uses to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, management relies on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content, and the source of the unprocessed metal. The Company’s estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, management periodically reviews shrink factors and performs monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of the Company’s scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required.

The Company’s estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, management periodically reviews shrink factors and performs monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of the Company’s scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, the Company further adjusts its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.","['To mitigate this risk, the Company further adjusts its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.']"
