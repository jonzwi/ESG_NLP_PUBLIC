In August 2021, the Flemish Government served 3M Belgium with a notice of intent  to impose a safety measure (wastewater discharge stoppage) and issued an infraction report alleging permit and/or legal  violations in connection with the discharge of certain specific PFAS compounds for alleged lack of specific authorization.  Following discussions with the government officials, 3M Belgium implemented a focused safety measure that would allow  continued production activities and plans to contest through appeal the underlying legal and factual basis for the safety measure.  Separately, the permitting authority has initiated a process to tighten the wastewater discharge limits immediately. In October  2021, the Province of Antwerp adopted lower discharge limits for the nine PFAS compounds specifically identified in the water  discharge permit and added a special condition that essentially prohibits discharge of any PFAS chemistry without a specific  limit in the permit. The action by the Province was timely appealed and a hearing on the appeal was held in January 2022. The  Flemish Regional Environmental Permit Commission subsequently issued a recommendation that the appeal be denied and that  lower limits on PFAS compounds be imposed immediately.
